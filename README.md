I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully completed a data analysis project focused on Netflix Movie Data, using core Python libraries and data science techniques.

Tools & Libraries Used:

Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

🔍 Project Workflow:

Imported and explored the dataset

Performed data preprocessing:

Checked for duplicate entries

Converted release dates from object to datetime format

Calculated basic statistics

Removed unused columns like overview, original_language, and poster_url

Categorized movies based on vote average into 4 classes:
🔸 Popular

Visualized key insights using bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps

📌 Questions Answered in the Analysis:

What is the most frequent genre of movies released on Netflix?

Which genre received the highest number of votes?

What movie had the highest popularity, and what is its genre?

What movie had the lowest popularity, and what is its genre?
